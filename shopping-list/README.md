# Shopping List

In this one we've created a fairly robust shopping list application utilizing local storage. We've created a number of handlers to update the state of the app as elements and items are added and removed, pushing and pulling them into and out of local storage. 

Additionally we cover event delegation and custom events to better handle different scenarios and concerns and keep our code flexible and dry. 

There are concerns with security issues but will address those later.
