# Audio Visualizer

Audio! This is the kind of stuff that really makes me want to dive deeper in javascript.  

We gather the stream of audio from the computer microphone, create a new audio context and analyzer, then pipe our stream through the analyzer. Next we decide how much data we want to be pull through and it into a new type of array. Lasly we draw the time and frequency data to the canvas. 

Used an external rgb to hsl function to make the frequency bars display the colors of the rainbow as opposed to just one color.
