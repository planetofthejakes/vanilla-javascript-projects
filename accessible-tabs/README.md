# Accessible Tabs

Click and switch between tabs on a webpage. We make use of aria and role attributes in the html in order to easily select and create better SEO for our page. This also allows us to avoid class selectors. 

On a play between attributes, selecting and looping, we hide and show the correlating panels to the tabs clicked.
