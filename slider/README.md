# Basic Slider

Similar to the Gallery exercise, we've created a mama Slider closure function where we pass through the two sliders on the same page so we can run the code for each without them clashing or causing problems. 

This one is all about assigning and reassigning classes to each other through destructuring and spreading so we don't run into any issues and want to become a farmer. We used parcel to run a local host to show how it can compile a css sass file even though we don't use sass features here.

Who said you can't farm and code!
