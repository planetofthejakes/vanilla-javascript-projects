# Modal Gallery

Full-fledged, feature-rich gallery which includes using keys and clicks to open and close the modal, as well as arrow keys and clicks to move through the gallery. 

We also include tab-index in the html for accessibility purposes and enable the use of the enter key to open the modal. 

We scoped all of the variables, functions, and listeners to the a mama Gallery closure function so we could repurpose the code for multiple galleres and they wouldn't clash with each other.
