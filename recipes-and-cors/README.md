# Recipe Search and CORS

We've created a recipe search application, fetching data from an API called Recipe Puppy. We work through dealing with CORS issues by getting a local server up and running, adding backwards browserlist compatibility, and setting up a proxy since we're dealing with non-sensitive data. 

The javascript for the application itself is a straightforward AJAX fetch and display of the search results on the page for the user to browse. We've also set a default recipe for pizza to show on page load.
