# Face Detection Censorship

Small project where we pixelate a persons face from their webcam using a Google Chrome experimental feature. 

We work on the following:
  * canvas to draw the pixelated face over the top 
  * async await promises to retrieve the webcam video feed
  * sliders to change the size and scale of the persons pixelated face

This was a fun one to do ðŸ˜Ž
